A number guessing game in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The game first comes up with a secret random number between 1 and 20.
The player tries to guess the number.
The player's score starts at 20.
If the number guessed is too high, a message is displayed and
a point is deducted from the score.

If the number is too low, a message is displayed and
a point is deducted from the score.

If the guess is correct, the background colour of the
page changes to light green, the number box is doubled in width
and a message is displayed to indicate that the guess is correct.
